# UnderwaterAcoustics.jl
### Julia toolbox for underwater acoustic modeling

```@meta
CurrentModule = UnderwaterAcoustics
```

## Highlights

- Underwater acoustic propagation modeling with pluggable models
- 2D/3D underwater acoustic simulation tools
- Differentiable and probabilistic underwater acoustic modeling
- Underwater acoustics utility functions

## Installation

```julia-repl
julia>]
pkg> add UnderwaterAcoustics
```

!!! warning "API change"

    The API has changed significantly in `UnderwaterAcoustics v0.4`. If you have code that depends
    on the old API, you may wish to refer to the [Porting guide](@ref) before you upgrade.

## Getting started

- [Propagation & channel modeling](@ref)
- [Channel replay](@ref)

## Documentation

- [Underwater acoustics](@ref)
- [Propagation & channel modeling API](@ref)
- [Developing your own propagation or channel models](@ref)
- [General utilities](@ref)
- [Porting guide](@ref) from `v0.3` to `v0.4` API
