import AcousticsToolbox
jdoc(AcousticsToolbox, :Kraken, 2)
```

A good overview of the Bellhop model can be found at:

- M. B. Porter, "The KRAKEN normal mode program", Technical report NRL/MR/5120-92-6920, Naval Research Laboratory, 1992 [(original report pdf)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA252409.pdf) [(updated draft pdf)](https://oalib-acoustics.org/website_resources/Modes/kraken.pdf).

## Example

Here's an example showing results for the PEKERIS test problem from the Kraken technical report:

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
using Plots
default(size=(600, 400))
```

```{julia}
using UnderwaterAcoustics
using AcousticsToolbox
using Plots

env = UnderwaterEnvironment(
  bathymetry = 5000,
  soundspeed = 1500,
  density = 1000,
  seabed = FluidBoundary(2000, 2000)
)
pm = Kraken(env)

tx = AcousticSource(0, -500, 10)
rx = AcousticReceiver(200000, -2500)
modes = arrivals(pm, tx, rx)[1:7]     # first 7 modes
```
```{julia}
# plot the modes
plot(modes[1:7])
```
```{julia}
rxs = AcousticReceiverGrid2D(200000:10:220000, -2500)
x = transmission_loss(pm, tx, rxs)

plot(200:0.01:220, x; ylims=(70,110), yflip=true, legend=false,
  xlabel="Range (km)", ylabel="Transmission loss (dB)")
```

## Notes

The Fortran Kraken propagation model requires that the transmitter is located at $(x=0, y=0)$ and all receivers are located in the right half-plane (i.e., $x>0$ and $y=0$). While this limitation can be worked around in the wrapper by a coordinate transformation, automatic transformation is not yet implemented.

Additionally, this wrapper does not yet support all the features of the original Fortran model. In particular, it does NOT support:

- N2-linear, analytic or quadratic interpolation for sound speed
- Arbitrary reflection coefficients
- Twersky scattering

Receivers on an irregular grid are supported, but not currently optimized for speed (by using the irregular grid option in the Fortran model).
